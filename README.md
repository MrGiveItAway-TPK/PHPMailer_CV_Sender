# PHP Mailer (CV Sender Example)

1.Copy folder to localhost.<br>
2.Create database called cv_email.<br>
3.Import Databases from Databases Example folder.<br>
4.Add in database Company Emails and Names that you want to send to and leave the rest empty.<br>
4.In Attachments Folder Paste Your CV As PDF.<br>
5.In php Folder update conn.php file.<br>
6.In php Folder update sendmail.php file with your info and email body where //Change tags are and whatever else you like.<br>
7.In PHPMAILER Folder update mail_inc.php file with your info where //Change tags are and whatever else you like (default configuration is for GMAIL).<br>
8.Just a tip when using gmail you need to turn off "Less secure app access" for this to work also when using this after a couple of emails it will not work and less secure apps will be on again to make a workaround for this just make for the phpmailer an app password and use it instead of your normal password in mail_inc.php for this to work for ever without limits.<br><br>
